# **High-Level Design: Decoupling with Message Queues**

This document explains how to decouple services in the notification system's design using message queues to improve reliability and fault tolerance.

## **Identifying Coupling Issues**

In the previous design, the Prioritization Service directly forwarded notifications to the respective Notification Sender Services. This tight coupling can lead to issues:

* **Processing Burden:** If one sender service slows down or becomes unresponsive, the Prioritization Service gets blocked, reducing overall system throughput.  
* **Failure Recovery:** If a sender service crashes, notifications in transit are lost, with no mechanism for recovery or retry.

## **Decoupling with Message Queues**

To address these issues, we introduce **message queues** between the Prioritization Service and the Notification Sender Services. This decouples the services, allowing them to operate independently and improving system resilience.

## **Benefits of Message Queues**

* **Reduced Burden on Prioritization Service:** Even if a sender service slows down, the Prioritization Service can continue processing and enqueueing notifications without being blocked.  
* **Retry Mechanism:** If a sender service fails, messages remain in the queue until the service recovers, ensuring no notifications are lost.  
* **Improved Fault Tolerance:** The system becomes more resilient to failures in individual sender services.

## **Optimized Notification Flow with Message Queues**

1. **Client Request:** The client sends a notification request to the API gateway.  
2. **Prioritization Service:** The request is processed and prioritized based on business rules.  
3. **Message Queue:** Notifications are enqueued, decoupling the Prioritization Service from the sender services.  
4. **Notification Sender Services:** Each sender service retrieves messages from the queue and processes them for delivery.  
5. **Delivery Channels:** The notifications are sent via appropriate channels like push notifications, SMS, or email.

By incorporating message queues, the notification system achieves greater scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance, ensuring seamless delivery even during service disruptions.
