# **High-Level Design: Optimizing Notification Flow**

This document describes further optimizations to the notification system's high-level design, focusing on the order of operations to improve efficiency and resource utilization.

## **Re-evaluating the Notification Flow**

The previous design had the following flow:

* **Prioritization \-\> Rate Limiting \-\> User Preferences**

While seemingly logical, this order has inefficiencies:

1. **Wasted Resources on Prioritization:** Prioritizing all notifications, including those that might be discarded later due to rate limits or user preferences, wastes processing power.  
2. **Wasted Resources on Validation:** Validating notifications before rate limiting can lead to unnecessary processing of notifications that will be discarded anyway.

## **Optimized Order of Operations**

To address these inefficiencies, the order of operations is adjusted:

* **Rate Limiting First:** By performing rate limiting before other steps, we ensure that only the allowed number of notifications per user are processed further, avoiding unnecessary validation and prioritization.  
* **Prioritization Last:** Prioritization is moved to the end of the flow to avoid wasting resources on notifications that might be filtered out.

## **Optimized Notification Flow**

The optimized flow is as follows:

1. **Client Request:** The client sends a notification request to the API gateway.  
2. **Rate Limiting:** The Rate Limiter checks if the user has exceeded their notification quota.  
3. **Rate Limiting Action:**  
   * If the quota is exceeded, the request is rejected.  
   * If within quota, the request proceeds.  
4. **User Preferences Validation:** The system checks the user's notification preferences to ensure compatibility.  
5. **Notification Validation:** The notification is validated for correctness and completeness.  
6. **Prioritization:** Notifications are prioritized based on urgency or importance.  
7. **Notification Delivery:** The validated and prioritized notifications are sent to the appropriate delivery channels.

## **Benefits of the Optimized Flow**

* **Improved Resource Utilization:** By discarding unnecessary notifications early, the system saves processing power and reduces bottlenecks.  
* **Enhanced Efficiency:** Processing fewer notifications leads to faster overall throughput.  
* **Better User Experience:** Prioritizing only valid and allowed notifications ensures timely delivery of important messages.
